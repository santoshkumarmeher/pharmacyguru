  <h4><b>Drug Classifications</b></h4>
  <p class="para">Drugs can be classified based on various factors such as their chemical composition, pharmacological effects, therapeutic uses, and legal status. Here are the primary classifications of drugs:</p>

  <b>1. By Chemical Composition:</b>
  <ul>
      <li>Organic Drugs: Drugs made from carbon-containing compounds (e.g., acetaminophen, morphine).</li>
      <li>Inorganic Drugs: Non-carbon based drugs (e.g., lithium, aluminum hydroxide).</li>
  </ul>

  <b>2. By Pharmacological Effects:</b>
  <ul>
      <li>Stimulants: Drugs that increase the activity of the central nervous system (CNS), e.g., caffeine, amphetamines.</li>
      <li>Depressants: Drugs that slow down brain activity, such as alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines.</li>
      <li>Analgesics (Pain Relievers): Drugs that reduce or alleviate pain, e.g., aspirin, opioids (morphine, fentanyl).</li>
      <li>Antipyretics: Drugs that reduce fever, such as acetaminophen.</li>
      <li>Antibiotics: Drugs that kill or inhibit bacteria, e.g., penicillin, amoxicillin.</li>
      <li>Antivirals: Drugs used to treat viral infections, e.g., acyclovir, antiretroviral drugs (ART).</li>
      <li>Antifungals: Drugs used to treat fungal infections, e.g., fluconazole, clotrimazole.</li>
      <li>Anxiolytics (Anti-anxiety Drugs): Drugs used to treat anxiety, such as diazepam, lorazepam.</li>
      <li>Antidepressants: Medications used to treat depression, like SSRIs (fluoxetine), tricyclics, and MAO inhibitors.</li>
      <li>Antipsychotics: Used to treat psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, e.g., olanzapine, haloperidol.</li>
  </ul>

  <b>3. By Therapeutic Uses:</b>
  <ul>
      <li>Antihypertensives: Drugs used to lower blood pressure, such as beta-blockers (atenolol) or ACE inhibitors (lisinopril).</li>
      <li>Diuretics: Drugs that promote the excretion of water and salts, like furosemide.</li>
      <li>Anticancer (Chemotherapeutic Agents): Drugs used to treat cancer, e.g., methotrexate, cisplatin.</li>
      <li>Immunosuppressants: Drugs that suppress the immune system, e.g., cyclosporine, corticosteroids.</li>
  </ul>

  <b>4. By Legal Status (Controlled Substances):</b>
  <ul>
      <li>Prescription Drugs: Drugs that require a doctor's prescription to be dispensed, such as antibiotics, opioids.</li>
      <li>Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs: Drugs available without a prescription, such as ibuprofen, paracetamol.</li>
      <li>Controlled Substances: Drugs regulated due to their potential for abuse and dependence, e.g., heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine.</li>
  </ul>

  <b>5. By Mode of Action:</b>
  <ul>
      <li>Agonists: Drugs that activate a receptor to produce a biological response (e.g., morphine activating opioid receptors).</li>
      <li>Antagonists: Drugs that block receptors and prevent activation (e.g., naloxone used to counteract opioid overdose).</li>
  </ul>

  <b>6. By Origin:</b>
  <ul>
      <li>Natural Drugs: Derived from plants, animals, or microorganisms (e.g., penicillin from mold, morphine from poppies).</li>
      <li>Synthetic Drugs: Chemically synthesized in laboratories (e.g., ibuprofen, synthetic opioids).</li>
      <li>Semi-synthetic Drugs: Drugs that are chemically modified derivatives of natural substances (e.g., heroin, oxycodone).</li>
  </ul>

  <b>7. By Risk Category (Commonly in Pregnancy):</b>
  <ul>
      <li>Category A: No risk to the fetus (e.g., folic acid).</li>
      <li>Category B: No risk to animals, but no adequate human studies (e.g., amoxicillin).</li>
      <li>Category C: Animal studies show adverse effects, but potential benefits may justify use (e.g., some antidepressants).</li>
      <li>Category D: Positive evidence of risk to the fetus, but benefits may outweigh risks (e.g., lithium).</li>
      <li>Category X: Contraindicated in pregnancy (e.g., isotretinoin).</li>
  </ul>
